I am an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I love solving algorithmic problems, working on deep learning projects, and am enthusiastic about learning new topics. I'm also a competitive programmer who regularly participates on platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, and CodeChef.
